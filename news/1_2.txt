Jun 15, 2023
On Saturday, June 10th, 2023 Unabomber Ted Kaczynski was found dead in his federal prison cell at age 81. A mathematics prodigy, Kaczynski received a Harvard education and worked as a professor at UC Berkeley before isolating himself from society. In a remote cabin in Montana, Kaczynski created a number of bombs targeting people who he believed were responsible for the industrialization of society and the advancement of technology.
Retired FBI Profiler Dr. Mary Ellen O’Toole shares her reaction to Kaczynski’s death and discusses her involvement in the Unabomber case. Later, she explains how the FBI looks out for warning signs exhibited by Kaczynski while investigating today’s criminals as well.
During her time with the FBI, Dr. O’Toole investigated various high-profile criminals and cases, including the Zodiac Killer, the Toy Box Killer, and the bombing at the 2002 Olympic games. Dr. O’Toole was one of the most senior profilers with the FBI and was recognized for her expertise in “psychopathy.” In her book, Dangerous Instincts, she details how readers can understand human behavior to keep themselves safe from harm.

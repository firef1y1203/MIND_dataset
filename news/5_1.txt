Late Friday afternoon when the University of Iowa was slipping into what students here call "the weekend mode," a brilliant former graduate student in physics stood up during a scheduled meeting in his department and began, without a word, to methodically extinguish some of the brightest minds the campus has known.
In a melee of no more than 10 minutes, the student, Gang Lu swiftly moved through two university buildings, seeking out six specific targets and shooting each person at close range with a .38-caliber revolver before fatally turning the weapon on himself, the authorities said here today. Four were killed immediately, a fifth died today and the sixth victim is in critical condition.

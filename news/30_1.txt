Day one after the fatal shots in Halle (Saale): The 27-year-old Stephan Balliet from Saxony-Anhalt was arrested as a presumed perpetrator. He apparently acted alone on site in Halle.

In the act, he wore a helmet camera with which he streamed a video live. The Minister of the Interior of Saxony-Anhalt, Holger Stahlknecht, confirmed the authenticity of the video. In the meantime, a document has also appeared, which seems to be an explanation of the attacker. Federal Prosecutor General Peter Frank assumes a right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic motivation and spoke of terror. Balliet is accused, among other things, of double murder and attempted murder in nine cases. In the course of this evening, the 27-year-old is to be presented to the investigating judge at the Federal Court of Justice.

We will inform you here about the latest developments.

In a communication, the Federal Prosecutor General at the Federal Court of Justice, Peter Frank, justified his application for an arrest warrant against the perpetrator of Halle. "Stephan B. planned a murder attack on fellow citizens of the Jewish faith out of his right-wing extremist and anti-Semitic attitude," it says.

He carried four firearms with him in the act, including at least one fully automatic. In addition, he had several explosive devices in the car. "The accused wanted to gain access to the church and kill as many people of Jewish faith as possible," writes the Federal Prosecutor General.

Among other things, an attempt to blow up a gate to a driveway failed. The perpetrator killed a woman who had asked him about his behavior by shooting him in the back. Out of frustration at his failure at the door of the synagogue, he then made the decision to "kill fellow citizens with a migration background." He then went to the kebab snack bar and shot a man there as well.

The further investigations would "in particular also deal with the question of whether persons were involved in the preparation or execution of the attack or were aware of it in advance". It continues: "So far, there is a lack of sufficient actual evidence that the accused was linked to a right-wing terrorist association or that there is any other connection with such an association."

It is still unclear whether the accused had produced the weapons and explosive devices himself or obtained them in any other way.

The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, has made serious accusations against the police in connection with the attack. "The fact that the synagogue in Halle was not protected by the police on a holiday like Yom Kippur is scandalous," he said.

There is no uniform concept for the protection of Jewish institutions in this country:

In Halle, hundreds of people gathered again on the market square that evening to commemorate the victims of the attack and to send an example against anti-Semitism. A memorial service was announced for 6 p.m. in the Pauluskirchen congregation, after which the participants want to go in silence to the synagogue, into which the perpetrator had tried to penetrate.

Saxony-Anhalt's Prime Minister Reiner Haseloff (CDU) and the non-partisan Lord Mayor Bernd Wiegand once again expressed their sympathy and called for civil courage against anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism. Both called on the people to set an example this Friday by forming a human chain in Saxony-Anhaltum synagogues. "Jewish life belongs to the city of Halle," said the mayor.

The anti-Semitism commissioners of the federal and state governments have strongly condemned the assassination of Halle an der Saale in a joint communication. "We deeply condemn this heinous attack on our liberal-democratic basic order," said the permanent federal-state commission to combat anti-Semitism.

"Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the relatives of the two people killed. We express our condolences to the Jewish community in Halle and at the same time to all Jews, whose highest religious festival was covered with pain, fear and grief by the attack and thus abruptly reversed," the anti-Semitism commissioners continued.

The attack leaves scars not only in the hearts of Jews in Germany. "Now it must be about standing together as a society, resolutely opposing destructive tendencies, and showing: Judaism belongs to us, that was an attack on all of us."

According to Saxony-Anhalt's Interior Minister Holger Stahlknecht (CDU), Stephan Balliet is said to have been the only shooter of the attack according to the current state of the investigation. "A second accused is not known to us, we assume that it was an individual perpetrator, always in the legal sense," he said when asked at a press conference in Halle.

Both Stahlknecht and Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) pointed out that it is now being determined whether Stephan Balliet was involved in an environment or networks. If someone had procured explosives and possessed weapons to that extent, one must illuminate with whom the man had contact and how he obtained them, said Seehofer. "This must be clearly distinguished from the execution of the crime

How dangerous can right-right hatred on the net become? And to what extent have the German security authorities missed the dangerous development? The assassination in Halle raises these questions, says SPIEGEL editor Wolf Wiedmannn-Schmidt in his video analysis.

SPD Secretary General Lars Klingbeil calls for consequences in the fight against right-wing extremists and anti-Semites. "Jewish life in Germany must be protected. There must be no doubt about that," Klingbeil told SPIEGEL.

When asked whether Jewish institutions should have general and permanent police protection, the Social Democrat said that it was "sad that we have to ask ourselves questions in our open, pluralistic country at all." But the developments of recent months have made permanent protection necessary.

After a club member of Halleschen FC died in the attack, fans mourned in front of the synagogue. "We all couldn't really believe what happened yesterday," said a young man to the dpa news agency. The person killed was part of the active fan scene.

"A family member of us died and that really sucks," said a friend of the killed. He criticized that there is talk primarily about the perpetrator and not about the victims.

The players of Halleschen FC competed in a non-public test match on Thursday in Trauerflor. "We are all still in shock," said the president of the third league club, Jens Rauschenbach.

The umbrella association of Islamic communities in Saxony-Anhalt has condemned the attacks in the strongest possible terms. "We are horrified and outraged by the cowardly and criminal terrors," said a statement distributed via Facebook. The communities were particularly shocked by the attack on the synagogue, where people should find their mental calm.

"We regard this attack on the Jewish holiday as a politically motivated terrorist attack," the umbrella association said. "Terrorists want to divide society and bring hatred and violence to our population." The board called on all people in Germany to oppose right-wing extremism - whether Jews, Christians, Muslims or religion-free fellow citizens.

Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer announced permanently better protection for Jewish institutions throughout Germany. Jewish facilities must be better protected - this will be done from now on, sustainably and permanently, said Seehofer. The better protection facilities must be additional.

The Migration Commissioner of the Federal Government, Annette Widmann-Mauz (CDU), is in favor of a special cabinet round to combat racism and anti-Semitism. "We need a special cabinet of cohesion and against racism, against anti-Semitism and misanthropy," said the Minister of State in the Federal Chancellery of the "SchwÃ¤bische Zeitung" in Friedrichshafen.

"We deal with climate, we deal with digitization - but what constitutes our society and its cohesion, we must cooperate - and with all departments - and that must give a new dimension," said Widmann-Mauz.

If you continue the state as well as the personal commitment against racism and anti-Semitism at the same level as before, "then we are very, very quickly back in a phase in which I at least do not want this country to come again."

The Prime Minister of Saxony-Anhalt, Reiner Haseloff (CDU), was shocked by the attack. At a joint press conference in Halle (Saale) with, among others, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) and the President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Josef Schuster, Haseloff stressed at the same time that society in the country will not be brought apart by the act, but will hold it together.

Jewish life is desired in Saxony-Anhalt, said Haseloff. The congregations in the country must be sure that they can hold their services. Saxony-Anhalt is a cosmopolitan country in which respect for human dignity and religious freedom are considered a high good. At the same time, Haseloff announced measures to protect against attacks, but did not express itself more concretely at first.

According to Federal Prosecutor General Peter Frank, the alleged perpetrator wanted to be an "imitator in the double sense." He had imitated comparable acts that had been committed before and "to our knowledge, he also wanted to incite others to imitate such acts," said Frank in Karlsruhe.

In the course of the investigation, Balliet's apartment was searched. Secured "Asservate" and also the weapons and explosives of the alleged perpetrator would now be criminally investigated. In addition, it is determined whether there might be supporters, confidants or others who might have incited him. The entire communication of the man is now being examined and determined what activities there have been in the so-called darknet.

The ex-pirate politician and digital expert Marina Weisband has spoken out against a single perpetrator thesis. "We are dealing with a right-wing extremist global movement that is digitally strongly networked and shares conventions and language," Weisband told the Neue OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung.

"The assassin of Halle is not a lone perpetrator. He is part of a new type of terrorist network," said the former pirate managing director. She described the reactions of political officials in Germany as incredibly ignorant. "A cloud was brewing. The fact that she is discharging was not surprising."

The foreign press also looks at the blood crime of Halle: It marks a new dimension of anti-Semitic violence in Germany. The voices from Israel are particularly concerned about the increasing right-wing extremism.

The anti-Semitic attack in Halle was already noticed far beyond Germany on Wednesday. The New York Times also reported when it became known that a right-wing extremist had tried to enter a synagogue heavily armed and shortly afterwards shot two passers-by. The incident is also the next day's topic in the comment columns of national and international newspapers.

"New York Times" (USA): Similarity to the Christchurch rampage

A heavily armed shooter with a livestream helmet camera tried to storm a synagogue in East Germany on Wednesday while believers celebrated the holiest day in Judaism. Held by a locked door, he killed two people outside and wounded two more in an anti-Semitic rampage that had the aftertaste of right-wing extremist terrorism. Hours later, the police announced the arrest of a suspect in the case of the city of Halle - from a whole series of attacks on Jews in Germany recently, this was one of the most shameless. (...)"

"Ha'aretz" (Israel): An attack on Jews and immigrants

The shots at the synagogue in East Germany were not just an anti-Semitic attack. It was also an attack on immigration (...). The main goal of the attacker in Halle was Jews in a synagogue on Yom Kippur. (...) And as we saw on Wednesday in Halle, the increased security at the synagogues saves lives. (...)

These are not organized or partly organized networks. But an ideology. (...) The explanation of the attacker in Halle is almost identical to that of the attacker, who murdered eleven Jews in a synagogue in Pittsburgh almost a year ago or the perpetrator from Christchurch, New Zealand, who killed 51 Muslims in prayer during a massacre in a mosque in March. It is a global, racist White Supremacy ideology (dominance of whites), which considers liberal openness to immigrants, women's and gay rights, and tolerance towards minorities as a threat to the white race. (...)

In order to carry out a neo-Nazi attack, no terrorist infrastructure is required. The perpetrators are local white men full of hostility and frustration, incited not only by right-wing extremist websites and literature, but also by alleged mainstream politicians, above all President Donald Trump."

"La Repubblica" (Italy): The contagious of terror

"He was one step away from swirling European history. Only an armored door prevented Stephan B. from immersing the Jewish festival Yom Kippur in blood and reopening the most dramatic wound of German identity. Even if he missed his main goal, yesterday's attack on the synagogue of Halle means a signal that can no longer be ignored: The fire of intolerance has returned to burn in our countries with a violence never seen before. The fire of Halle is not an isolated case. And you can't reduce it to an episode of madness. Instead, we are facing the most serious threat to our democracies: in contrast to Islamic terrorism, it does not come from external worlds. It is the fruit of something that lives in the depths of European society and that quickly kills the antibodies that developed after the bloodbath of World War II."

"NZZ" (Switzerland): Thousands saw him murder

"A white man who murders out of right-wing radical hatred. Who films his act and broadcasts it live via social networks. Who publishes a manifesto on the Internet. The actions of the perpetrator of Halle are strongly reminiscent of that of the assassin of Christchurch, who murdered 50 people in two mosques in March.

These parallels should not be a coincidence. Brenton T., the murderer of Christchurch, had written a script with his approach in March, which found several imitators - among them probably the assassin of Halle. (...) T. streamed his act live on Facebook, the assassin of Halle chose Twitch, a video platform bought by Amazon in 2014. Twitch announced on Wednesday via Twitter that the live broadcast had been watched by about five people. The recording of the stream was then seen by about 2200 people before it was reported to Twitch as problematic. The "hash" of the video was then shared with other social media companies to prevent the spread. (...) The assassin of Halle was not able to generate the same worldwide attention as his alleged role model in Christchurch. Nevertheless, thousands saw him murder on Wednesday."

"Leipziger Volkszeitung": Attack in Halle

In Halle, the identitarian movement runs a house in the middle of the city - the identitarian movement that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution classified as clearly right-wing extremist in the summer and which, among other things, maintains contacts with parts of the AfD. In Saxony-Anhalt - more precisely: in Tröglitz - it was also where a refugee shelter burned in the spring of 2015 and the brave mayor Markus Nierth resigned. The state government has put the dangers from the right into perspective later on and again under the impression of the strengthening of the AfD - fatally. What applies to Halle applies to the whole country. The militancy of the right-wing extremist scene is growing. It appears more and more blatantly and sometimes even seeps into the security authorities."

"Schwäbische Zeitung": The hatred of Jews was never gone.

"Insult, blows in the face, attempted manslaughter - the list of violence against Jews in Germany is long. If the doors of the synagogue in Halle had not withstood the rifle shots of the German perpetrator, Jewish believers would have fallen victim to a massacre. This idea makes you stunned. For decades, German society has dealt with its historical guilt. But the hatred of Jews was never gone. The Federal Government's anti-Semitism commissioner recently warned that he could not recommend Jews to wear the kippa everywhere in Germany at any time. After the attack, it was said that politicians had to react. But that's not enough. Every individual must stand up against anti-Semitism: Do not remain silent when lies about Jews are spread in the sports club, in the circle of friends or in the family. The realization that inhumane deeds result from inhuman thinking is not new. It was only proven again on Wednesday."

"General-Anzeiger": No more Sundays

The blood crime of Halle marks a new dimension of anti-Semitic violence. While Jews in Germany have been exposed to insults and attacks almost daily and more frequently on the street, they must now fear for their lives. A shocking finding. (...) From Halle, of this Yom Kippur 2019, a clear sign must therefore emanate: Society must no longer accept anti-Semitism in silence. Not on the Internet, not in the family, not among friends, not at work. Anti-Semitism, whether right, left, in the middle or among Muslims, must have no place. No more indifference. No Sunday talk. The sentence 'Never again!' must be filled with new life. Never again - new efforts are needed so that this promise can be kept."

"Fuldaer Zeitung": A frightening blood toll

"The two dead and the injured are a frightening blood toll. And this weighs all the more seriously because almost 81 years after the destruction organized by the Nazis and the desire to murder in the Reichspogromnacht, attacks have now been carried out again on the Jewish community in Germany. Despite all the final lines, who do not want the mass murder of the Jews of Europe, which was industrially organized in the Nazi rule, to be considered historically unprecedented, but as another "unsunplorable" date of history next to Napoleon, the Hun king Attila or the conquests of the Romans, such an attack on German soil is a shameful with special effect

"Badische Neueste Nachrichten": On the day of reconciliation, of all places

"In Israel, Yom Kippur is also commemorated as the victims of the war of 1973, when Egypt and Syria attacked the country. The tragic pictures of the 2019 holiday come from Germany, from a country where such pictures should no longer exist. Crimes against Jews in Germany are deeply buried in the collective memory. The fact that the pictures can be seen on the day of reconciliation, of all places, does not only affect the heart of the Jewish community."

"Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung": It is also about self-presentation in digital media

"You have to be ashamed that Jewish (as well as Muslim) life in Germany is no longer safe. If it ever was. Why? Why? How can that be? How sad, how brutal is that, how stupid. Questions are addressed to the security forces after such acts. Negligence in recent years has raised the suspicion that some things could go better for them, possibly especially in Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt. And another question is addressed not only to the perpetrator, but also to society. The neo-Nazi broadcast his deeds live on the Internet, in all details. So he was not only concerned with the most spectacular murders possible, but also with self-expression in digital media. A trend that also holds dangers."

"Stuttgarter Nachrichten": There were enough signs

"No one said that no one could have guessed that, let alone know it. The attack in Halle came as a complete surprise. Because there were enough signs: The number of anti-Jewish crimes increased by 20 percent compared to 2017 - to 1799 - in Germany alone in 2018. Baden-Württemberg's anti-Semitism commissioner Michael Blume had already warned of the "racely growing danger of open anti-Semitism and a growing number of anti-Semitism crimes" in the summer.

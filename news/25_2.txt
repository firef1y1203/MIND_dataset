SUICIDE CRASH KID’S FAMILY PARTY PLAN

The evening 15-year-old Charles Bishop crashed a stolen plane into a Tampa skyscraper, he was supposed to go to a party thrown by his grandmother in honor of the completion of his first night flight, a family spokesman said yesterday in Florida.

The celebration-turned-tragedy was one of several details that St. Petersburg lawyer and Bishop family spokeswoman Pamela Campbell revealed yesterday about the student pilot.

Authorities said they found a suicide note in Bishop’s pocket praising terror lord Osama bin Laden and the 19 hijackers responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks.

Police said Bishop – who crashed a Cessna into the Bank of America building Jan. 5 – had warned a friend in an e-mail hours before the flight that he was “going to be on the news.”

Campbell said that Charles’ mother, Julia Bishop, has not seen the suicide note – and dismissed police accusations that he was a pimple-faced loner who didn’t have any friends.

“She had no inkling this was coming,” she said. “Suicide wasn’t anything they would have even imagined.

“He cared about the world his generation was inheriting and took special interest in environmental-impact issues, animal rights and endangered-species laws, and the new world of national politics which impacts all of these issues,” she said.

Campbell refused to discuss the boy’s use of Accutane, an acne drug linked to depression in a number of teenagers.

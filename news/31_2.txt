NEW YORK POST: FROM APRIL 20, 1995
Laura Harris
“A terrorist bomb blast yesterday jolted Oklahoma City, in America’s heartland, just as workers were starting their day. It shattered the downtown Alfred Murrah Federal Building just after 9 a.m., an attack eerily reminiscent of the blast that rocked New York’s World Trade Center two years ago. It claimed the lives of young and old without prejudice, left hundreds of injured in the burning rubble, and frustrated rescue workers who couldn’t reach the victims fast enough. And it put fear in the hearts of a nation.”

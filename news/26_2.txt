Texas man pleads guilty in attempted bombing
PLANO, Texas — A man charged with trying to blow up a North Texas natural gas pipeline in 2012 has pleaded guilty to two of the charges he faced at trial.

Anson Chi entered the plea late Monday after the end of the first day of his federal court trial in Plano, Texas. The Dallas Morning News reports Chi pleaded guilty to possessing a destructive device. Chi also pleaded guilty to a charge of using that explosive device maliciously.

Chi’s sentence is left to the discretion of U.S. District Judge Richard Schell.

Chi was arrested in 2012 in Plano, northeast of Dallas, near a small explosion by a natural-gas pipeline. The blast caused minimal damage but critically injured Chi.

Letters show Chi for a time corresponded with Unabomber Ted Kaczynski.

"Mailboxes are exploding! Why, you ask?
Attention people.
You do things because you can and want (desire) to If the government controls what you want to do, they control what you can do. If you are under the impression that death exists, and you fear it, you do anything to avoid it. (This is the same way pain operates. Naturally we strive to avoid negative emotion/pain.)
You allow yourself to fear death! 
World authorities allowed, and still allow you to fear death! 
In avoiding death you are forced to conform, if you fail to conform, you suffer mentally and physically. (Are world powers utilizing the natural survival instinct in a way that allows them to capitalize on the people?) 
To "live" (avoid death) in this society you are forced to conform/slave away. I?m here to help you realize/ understand that you will live no matter what! It is up to you people to open your hearts and minds. There is no such thing as death. 
The people I?ve dismissed from this reality are not at all dead. Conforming to the boundaries, and restrictions imposed by the government only reduces the substance in your lives. When 1% of the nation controls 99% of the nations total wealth, is it a wonder why there are control problems? 
The United States strives to provide freedom for their people. Do we really have personal freedom? I?ve lived here for many years, and I see much limitation. Does the definition of freedom include limitation? I?ve learned about the history of various civilizations in history, and I see more and more limitation. Do you people enjoy this trend of limitation? If not, change it!
As long as you are uninformed about death you will continue to say "how high", when the government tells you to "jump". As long as the government is uninformed about death they will continue tell you to "jump" Is the government uninformed about death, or are they pretending? 
You have been missing how things are, for very long. I?m obtaining your attention in the only way I can. More info is on its way. More "attention getters? are on the way. If I could, I would change only one person, unfortunately the resources are not accessible. It seems killing a single famous person would get the same media attention as killing numerous un-famous humans. There is less risk of being detained, associated with dismissing certain people.
Sincerely,
Someone Who Cares

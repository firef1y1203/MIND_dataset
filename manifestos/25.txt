There will be more coming! Al-Qaeda and other organizations have met with me several times to discuss the option of me joining.
I didn’t.
This is an operation done by me only. I had no other help, although I am acting on their behalf. Osama Bin Laden is planning on blowing up the Super Bowl with an antiquated nuclear bomb left over from the 1967 Israeli-Syrian War.
I have prepared this statement in regards to the acts I am about to commit. First of all, Osama Bin Laden is absolutely justified in the terror he has caused on 9–11. He has brought a mighty nation to its knees! God blesses him and the others who helped make September 11th happen.
The U.S. will have to face the consequences for its horrific actions against the Palestinian people and Iraq by its allegiance with the monstrous Israelis — who want nothing short of world domination!
You will pay — God help you — and I will make you pay!

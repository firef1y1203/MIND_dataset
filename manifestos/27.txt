 The GreatReplacement

Do not go gentle into that good night,Old age should burn and rave at close of day;Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,Because their words had forked no lightning theyDo not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how brightTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,Do not go gentle into that good night.Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sightBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,Rage, rage against the dying of the light.And you, my father, there on the sad height,Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.Do not go gentle into that good night.Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

IntroductionIt’s the birthrates.It’s the birthrates.It’s the birthrates.If there is one thing I want you to remember from these writings, its that the birthrates must change. Even if we were to deport all Non-Europeans from our lands tomorrow, the European people would still be spiraling into decay and eventual death.Every day we become fewer in number, we grow older,we grow weaker.In the end we must return to replacement fertility levels, or it will kill us.To maintain a population the people must achieve a birthrate that reaches replacement fertility levels. In the Western world this is roughly 2.06 births per woman.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependencies_by_total_fertility_rateThere is not a single Western country, not a single white nation, that reaches these levels.Not in Europe, not in the Americas, not in Australia or New Zealand.White people are failing to reproduce, failing to create families, failing to have children.But despite this sub-replacement fertility rate, the population in the West is increasing, and rapidly.How is this possible?Mass immigration and the higher fertility rates of the immigrants themselves are causing this increase in population.We are experiencing an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders, legally.Invited by the stateand corporate entities to replace the White people who have failed to reproduce, failed to create the cheap labour, new consumers and tax base that the corporations and states need to thrive.This crisis of mass immigration and sub-replacement fertility is an assaulton the European people that, if not combated, will ultimately result in the complete racial and cultural replacement of the European people.

To see this in full effect, you only have to look at the population statisticsin Western nations for the year 2100.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_future_population_(United_Nations,_medium_fertility_variant)In 2100,despite the ongoing effect of sub-replacement fertility,the population figures show that the population does not decrease inline with the sub-replacement fertility levels, but actually maintains and, even in many White nations, rapidly increases.All through immigration.This is ethnic replacement.This is cultural replacement.This is racial replacement.This is WHITE GENOCIDE.To return to replacement fertility levels is priority number one. But it is no simple task.There are myriad reasons behind the decline in fertility rates and the destruction of the traditional family unit.We must inevitably correct the disaster of hedonistic,nihilistic individualism. But it will take take some time, time we do not have due tothe crisis of mass immigration.Due to mass immigration we lack the time scale required to enact the civilizational paradigm shift we need to undertake to return to health and prosperity.Mass immigration will disenfranchise us,subvert our nations, destroy our communities, destroy our ethnic binds, destroy our cultures, destroy our peoples.Long before low fertility levels ever could.Thus, before we deal with the fertility rates, we must deal with both the invaders within our lands and the invaders that seek to enter our lands.We must crush immigration and deport those invaders already living on our soil. It is not just a matter of our prosperity, but the very survival of our people.

Answering possible questions1.In generalWho are you?Just a ordinary White man,28 years old. Born in Australia to a working class,low income family. My parents are of Scottish,Irish and English stock.I had a regular childhood, without any great issues.I had little interest in education during my schooling, barely achieving a passing grade. I did not attend University as I had no great interest in anything offered inthe Universities to study. I worked for a short time before making some money investing in Bitconnect, then used the money from the investment to travel. More recently I have been working part time as a kebab removalist.I am just a regular White man, from a regular family. Who decided to take a stand to ensure a future for my people.Why did you carry out the attack?To most of all show the invaders that our lands will never be their lands, our homelands are our own and that, as long as a white man still lives, they will NEVER conquer our lands and they will never replace our people.To take revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by foreign invaders in European lands throughout history.To take revenge for the enslavement of millions of Europeans taken from their lands by the Islamic slavers.To take revenge for the thousands of European lives lost to terror attacks throughout European lands.To take revenge for Ebba Akerlund.To directly reduce immigration rates to European lands by intimidating and physically removing the invaders themselves.To agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to cause them tooverextend their own hand and experience the eventual and inevitable backlash as a result.

To incite violence, retaliation and further divide between the European people and the invaders currently occupying European soil.To avenge those European men and women lost in the constant and neverending wars of European history who died for their lands, died for their people only to have their lands given away to any foreign scum that bother to show up.To agitate the political enemies of my people into action, to over extend their own hand and experience the eventual backlash.To show the effect of direct action, lighting a path forward for those that wish to follow.A path for those that wish to free their ancestors lands from the invaders grasp and to be a beacon for those that wish to create a lasting culture, to tell them they are not alone.To create an atmosphere of fear and change in which drastic,powerful andrevolutionary action can occur.To add momentum to the pendulum swings of history, further destabilizing and polarizing Western society in order to eventually destroy the current nihilistic, hedonistic, individualistic insanity that has taken control of Western thought.To drive a wedge between the nations of NATO that are European and the Turks that also make a part of the NATO forces, thereby turning NATO once more into a united European army and pushing the Turkey once more back to the true position of a foreign, enemy force.Finally, to create conflict between the two ideologies within the United States on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural,political and racial divide within the United states.This conflict over the 2nd amendment and the attempted removal of firearms rights will ultimately result in a civil war that will eventually balkanize the US alongpolitical, cultural and, most importantly, racial lines.This balkanization of the US will not only result in the racial separation of the people within the United States ensuring the future of the White race on the North American continent, but also ensuring the death of the “melting pot” pipe dream.Furthermore this balkanization will also reduce the USA’s ability to project power globally, and thereby ensure that never again can such a situation as the US involvement in Kosovo ever occur again(where 
US/NATO forces fought beside muslims and slaughtered Christian Europeans attempting to remove these Islamic occupiers from Europe).What do you want?We must ensure the existence of our people, and a future for white children.Was there a particular event or reason you decided to commit to a violent attack?There was a period of time 2 years prior to the attack to the attack that dramatically changed my views.The period of time was from, beginning of April,2017 until the end May,2017. In this time period a series of events broke down my own reserves, my reservations, my cynicism and revealed the truth of the Wests current situation. These events turned my thoughts from pursuing a democratic, political solution and finally caused the revelation of the truth, that a violent, revolutionary solution is the only possible solution to our current crisis.I was travelling as a tourist in Western Europe at the time, France, Spain Portugal and others.The first event that begun the change was the terror attack in Stockholm, on the 7th of April 2017. It was another terror attack in the seemingly never ending attacks that had been occurring on a regular basis throughout my adult life. But for some reason this was different. The jaded cynicism with which I had greeted previous attacks didn’t eventuate. Something that had been a part of my life for as long as I could remember, cynicism in the face of attacks on the West by islamic invaders, was suddenly no longer there. I could no longer bring the sneer to my face, I could no longer turn my back on the violence. Something, this time, was different.That difference was Ebba Akerlund.Young, innocent and dead Ebba.Ebba was walking to meet her mother after school, when she was murdered by an Islamic attacker, driving a stolen vehicle through the shopping promenade on which she was walking. Ebba was partially deaf, unable to hear the attacker coming.Ebba death at the hands of the invaders, the indignity of her violent demise and my inability to stop it broke through my own jaded cynicism like a sledgehammer.
I could no longer ignore the attacks. They were attacks on my people, attacks on my culture, attacks on my faith and attacks on my soul. They would not be ignored.The second event was the 2017 French General election. The candidates were an obvious sign of our times: a globalist, capitalist, egalitarian, an ex-investment banker was no national beliefs other than the pursuit of profit versus a milquetoast,feckless, civic nationalist, an uncontroversial figure who’s most brave and inspired idea resolved to the possible deportation of illegal immigrants.Despite this ridiculous match up, the possibility of a victory by the quasi-nationalist was at least, to myself, a sign that maybe a political solution was still possible.The internationalist, globalist, anti-white, ex-banker won. It wasn’t even close. The truth of the political situation in Europe was suddenly impossible to accept.My despair set in.My belief in a democratic solution vanished.The final push was witnessing the state of French cities and towns. For many years I had been hearing and reading of the invasion of France by non-whites, many of these rumours and stories I believed to be exaggerations, created to push a political narrative. But once I arrived in France, I found the stories to not only be true, but profoundly understated. In every french city, in every french town the invaders were there.No matter where I travelled, no matter how small or rural the community I visited, the invaders were there.The french people were often in a minority themselves, and the french that were in the streets were often alone, childless or of advanced age.Whilst the immigrants were young, energized and with large families and many children. I remember pulling into a shopping centre car park to buy groceries in some moderate sized town in Eastern France, of roughly 15-25 thousand people. As I sat there in the parking lot, in my rental car, I watched a stream of the invaders walk through the shopping centre’s front doors.For every french man or woman there was double the number of invaders.I had seen enough, and in anger, drove out of the the town, refusing to stay any longer in the cursed place and headed on to the next town.Driving toward the next french town on my itinerary, knowing that inevitably the invaders would also been there, I found my emotions swinging between fuming rage and suffocating despair at the indignity of 
the invasion of France, the pessimism of the french people, the loss of culture and identity and the farce of the political solutions offered. I came upon a cemetery, one of the many mass cemeteries created to burythe French and other European soldiers lost in the Wars that crippled Europe. I had seen many pictures and heard many people discuss the cemeteries, but even knowing about these cemeteries in advance, I was still not prepared for the sight.Simple, white, wooden crosses stretching from the fields beside the roadway, seemingly without end, into the horizon. Their number uncountable, the representation of their loss unfathomable. I pulled my rental car over, and sat, staring at these crosses and contemplating how it was that despite these men and womens sacrifice, despite their bravery, we had still fallen so far.I broke into tears, sobbing alone in the car, staring at the crosses, at the forgotten dead.Why were we allowing these soldiers deaths to be in vain? Why were we allowing the invaders to conquer us? Overcome us? Without a single shotfired in response?WHY WON’T SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING?In front of those endless crosses, in front of those dead soldiers lost in forgotten wars, my despair turned to shame,my shame to guilt,my guilt toanger and my anger to rage.WHY WON’T SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING?WHY WON’T SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING?WHY DON’T I DO SOMETHING?The spell broke, why don’t I do something?Why not me?If not me, then who?Why them when I could do it myself?It was there I decided to do something, it was there I decided to take action, to commit to force.To commit to violence.To take the fight to the invaders myself.
